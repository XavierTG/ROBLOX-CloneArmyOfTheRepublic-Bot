# ROBLOX-CloneArmyOfTheRepublic-Bot
This file talks about the concepts for the new work in progress bot to be used by the -Clone Army Of The Republic-. The bot is currently still a work in progress.
## Main Concept
The main concept of the bot is that it will interact with live -CAR- servers. For example, if an announcement is made in discord, the bot will tell the -CAR- game servers to display that announcement as a popup. Or if a person is breaking the rules and needs to be kicked but a high command member cannot get into the game, they can kick the in-game player causing trouble from the discord server. Etcetera, you get the idea. In short, the bot will be able relay information to live servers, opening up possibilities for numerous new features.
## Side Concept
Side concept coming soon.
